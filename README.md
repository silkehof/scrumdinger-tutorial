# Scrumdinger: Managing and documeting Scrum meetings

This app has been built following an offical [Swift tutorial](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/app-dev-training/getting-started-with-scrumdinger "Scrumdinger Swift Tutorial") to learn and practice the basics of Swift and iOS development. 

The Scrumdinger app allows users to plan, conduct and document scrum meetings. The app helps to time meetings and speakers, and transcribes the meeting if microphone access is enabled.
